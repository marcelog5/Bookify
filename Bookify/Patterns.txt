- Static Factory Pattern

Used to create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to a newly created object using a common interface.
Can be used to do some side effect when creating an object.

- Primitive obsession (anti-pattern)
Use a class instead of a primitive type to represent a concept.
In this project, instead of a class, I`m using a record to represent the concept of a Address
Records is good to this aproach because it is immutable.
